<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a PhD student at the [Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR)](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk), affiliated with the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC), University of Edinburgh. I'm advised by [Dr. Catherine Lai](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/) and [Prof. Peter Bell](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbell1/), and fully funded by the School of Informatics. I was an Enrichment student at the Alan Turing Institute, and a research intern at Microsoft Research <img src='./images/msr.png' style="width: 4em;">.

My research aims to advance spoken language technologies in real-world applications by bridging different but relevant domains such as linguistics & paralinguistics, speech & language, emotion & health, etc. In particular, my work focuses on problems that hinder the broader use of spoken language technologies in the wild.

Before starting my PhD, I used to research on affective computing and human-robot interaction at Honda Innovation Lab, [Hiroshi Ishiguro Lab ATR](http://www.geminoid.jp/en/index.html), and [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/).
I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tatsuya Kawahara](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/kawahara/) (FIEEE), [Prof. Nigel Ward](https://hb2504.utep.edu/Home/Profile?username=nigel), and [Prof. Carlos Ishi](http://www.irc.atr.jp/~carlos/).
